                <article role="article">
                    <h2>Competence</h2>
                    <p>Before and during my professional time, I have accumulated a lot of knowledge, both technical skills, and knowledge in the management of small teams with a lot of movement (consulting-based teams) and architectural solutions.</p>

                    <h3>Technology</h3>
                    <p>My track record can be made long and complicated, but below is a selection of knowledge I have. WordPress has long been my main area of ​​work, and I can now say that <strong>I have worked actively with the CMS for over 10 years.</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>WordPress (Plugin and theme development)</li>
                        <li>Cache (page, object and fragment -cache)</li>
                        <li>Databases (MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL)</li>
                        <li>JavaScript (Vanilla JS, jQuery)</li>
                        <li>Templating (Laravel Blade, Handlebars)</li>
                        <li>Laravel</li>
                        <li>PHP 8 (incl. OOP)</li>
                        <li>JSON Restful API</li>
                        <li>DevOps & Hosting in Linux environments</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Leadership</h3>
                    <p>During my time at the City of Helsingborg, I have had a role that has involved a certain leadership, for employees and consultants. I often use a method that has been very trust-based, aiming towards giving colleagues a good informative basis to work from. By giving them the business and architectural knowledge relevant to the task, they can do what they excel at even better. Moreover by making reasonable and well-informed design decisions close to the code on an ongoing basis.</p>
                    <p>I tend to find myself in a leadership position in the group with great support from my colleagues.</p>

                    <h3>Architecture</h3>
                    <p>For the past 5 years, in parallel with the development assignment, I have had a strong focus on the architecture of applications. I always work with accepted standards as a basis for my design, to facilitate a swift onboarding and efficient dialogue in teams. I do value good solutions in favor of "fancy solutions". In practice, this results in products with short lead times to a high-quality ratio.</p>
                    <p>I greatly appreciate well-documented (although simple and easy to read) applications. In the architect role, I strongly rely on the <a href="https://c4model.com/" class="u-printable-url">C4 model</a> in combination with <a href="https://standard.publiccode.net/" class="u-printable-url">Foundation for Public Code Standard</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>During my high school years, I made the choice to focus on the technical program. Then with options strongly focused on programming in, among other things, VB.NET, .NET C #, HTML, CSS and Java. This in combination with optional courses in music and media production.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after I graduated, I chose to apply for further studies. Since I like to broaden my knowledge base, I studied Informatics at Halmstad University. During my college years, I studied mixed courses in computer science, which include; Multimedia, IT Strategy, Interaction Design, Visual-Basic, Business Systems, Network Technology, ASP.NET and Systems Development. Overall, the courses link to information flows and the structure of larger organizations.</p>

                    <h3>Other</h3>
                    <p>Programming has been an interest of mine since the age of 14. Even then, I realized that it was web development that was most interesting. Largely because it is a technology that allows a short process from idea to launch.</p>

                    <p>This page is built with simple techniques from the perspective of "less is more". All technology choices are balanced and tailored to needs. The page size is below 200kb; which usually corresponds to less than a single smaller image on a normal website. To put the figure in perspective, several surveys conducted in 2018 showed that the average value for a modern website is 3MB.</p>

                    <p>Performance is the most valuable converter available, it is proven that it leads to more sales and satisfied visitors. In my opinion, it is a player that can be equated with good design and usability.</p>
